<div class="submission-upload p-3 d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
  <i class="fas fa-file-upload"></i>
</div>

  This is the most minimal example of Dropzone. The upload in this example
  doesn't work, because there is no actual server to handle the file upload.

<!-- Change /upload-target to your upload address -->
<form action="<%= exercise_submissions_path(@lecture.exercise) %>" class="dropzone"></form>
